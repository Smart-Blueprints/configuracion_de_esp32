## 1. Install the Communication Port Driver

  Connect the ESP32 to your PC.

  Open the Device Manager tool.

  ![Device Manager Tool](images/device-manager-tool.png)

  Navigate to Device Manager.

## 2. Install the Arduino IDE

  Install **version 1.8.19** provided in the class folder.

---

## 3. Install ESP32 Boards

  Go to Preferences.

  ![Preferences](images/preferences.png)

  Paste the following URLs into the **Additional Boards Manager URLs** field and click **OK**:

  https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json

## 4. Install the Required Libraries

  Go to Manage Libraries.

  ![Manage Libraries](images/manage-libraries.png)

  Install the following libraries:

  - `ArduinoHttpClient`
  - `Wifi`
  - `ESP32Servo`
  - `LiquidCrystalI2C`
  - `ThingsBoard`

## 5. Run the Test Codes

  **Code 1 - Sensors**:  
  - Upload the code to the ESP32 board.
  - This code receives and displays sensor measurements from the smart home.
  - Open the Serial Monitor to view measurements of the 5 parameters every 3 seconds.

  **Code 2 - Servo**:  
  - Upload the code to the ESP32 board.
  - This code controls one of the smart homeâ€™s servomotors.
  - You can modify the pin linked to the `Servo` object to move the door or the window:
    - Pin **18** for the window.
    - Pin **19** for the door.
  - Observe how the servo moves incrementally in one direction and then returns to its initial position in a single movement. This process repeats indefinitely.

  **Code 3 - PWM_LED**:  
  - Upload the code to the ESP32 board.
  - This code uses the ESP32's PWM output to gradually turn a LED on and off (**breathing light effect**).
  - You can modify the pin linked to control either of the two LEDs in the smart home:
    - Pin **12** for the yellow LED.
    - Pin **4** for the white LED.
  - Observe how the LED starts off, gradually increases brightness to its maximum, and then dims back down. This process repeats indefinitely.

  **Code 4 - PWM_FAN**:  
  - Upload the code to the ESP32 board.
  - This code uses the ESP32's PWM output to gradually turn the fan on and off.
  - Observe how the fan starts off, gradually increases speed to its maximum, and then slows down until it stops. This process repeats indefinitely.

  **Code 5 - Passw**:  
  - Upload the code to the ESP32 board.
  - This code simulates an authentication system for the smart home.  
    - The left yellow button inputs the password, and the right yellow button acts as the "Enter" button.
    - A short press on the left button represents `"*"`, and a long press represents `"_"`.
    - The password is: **`**_*`**.

  > **Note**: These codes can be modified to perform other actions with the devices connected to the smart home.
